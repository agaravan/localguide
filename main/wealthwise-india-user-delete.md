## How to Delete Your WealthWise India Profile and Data

Your privacy is important to us. This document outlines how you can permanently delete your WealthWise India profile and all associated data from our database.

**Important Note:** Deleting your profile is a permanent action. Once confirmed, all your user data, including your WealthWise India contributions (reviews, photos, edits), profile information, and any other related data, will be irreversibly removed from our system. This action cannot be undone.

### Steps to Delete Your Profile:

1.  **Navigate to Settings:**
    * Open the WealthWise India app on your device.
    * Tap on your profile picture or the menu icon (usually three horizontal lines) to open the side menu.
    * Select "Settings."

2.  **Locate the "Delete My Profile" Button:**
    * Within the "Settings" menu, scroll down until you find the "Delete My Account" button. This button is typically located under a "Account" or "Privacy" section.

3.  **Initiate Deletion:**
    * Tap on the "Delete My Profile" button.

4.  **Confirm Deletion:**
    * A confirmation pop-up or screen will appear, clearly stating the implications of deleting your profile (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete your profile? This action is permanent and will remove all your contributions, photos, and profile data.").
    * To proceed, you will likely be asked to:
        * **Read and acknowledge** the information.
        * **Type a confirmation word** (e.g., "DELETE" or "CONFIRM") into a designated field to ensure intentionality.
        * **Tap a final "Confirm" or "Delete" button.**

5.  **Data Deletion Process:**
    * Once you confirm, the app will initiate the process of removing all your user, feed, and image data, along with any other related information, from our database.
    * You may receive an in-app notification or an email confirming that your deletion request has been received and is being processed.
    * **Please allow up to [X] days** (e.g., 7-14 days, specify a realistic timeframe) for the complete removal of your data from all our systems. During this period, your account may become inaccessible.

### What Happens When You Delete Your Profile:

* **All your WealthWise India contributions:** This includes reviews, ratings, photos, videos, edits, and any other content you have submitted.
* **Your profile information:** Your username, email address, profile picture, and any other personal details associated with your WealthWise India account.
* **Feed data:** Any personalized feeds, activity logs, or recommendations based on your usage.
* **Associated data:** Any other data points directly linked to your WealthWise India profile in our database.

### Legal and Compliance Considerations:

* We comply with all applicable data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Your right to erasure ("right to be forgotten") is respected.
* In rare cases, certain data may be retained if there is a legal obligation to do so (e.g., for financial records if your app involves transactions) or for legitimate public interest reasons, but any such retained data will be anonymized where possible.
* If you have any concerns or questions regarding data deletion, please contact our support team at support@localguidesapp.com.

**Additional Tips for Your App's Implementation and Documentation:**

* **Clear Visuals:** Include screenshots of the "Settings" screen, the "Delete My Profile" button, and the confirmation pop-up within your document.
* **Accessibility:** Ensure this "how-to" document is easily accessible from within the app (e.g., linked directly from the "Settings" or "Privacy Policy" sections).
* **Email Confirmation:** It's good practice to send an email to the user's registered email address after they initiate the deletion, confirming the request and reiterating the permanent nature of the action.
* **Support Contact:** Always provide a clear way for users to contact support if they have issues or further questions about data deletion.
* **Server-Side Deletion:** Emphasize that the deletion process is from your database, not just from the user's local device cache.
* **Google Play & Apple App Store Requirements:** Remember that both Google Play and Apple App Store have specific requirements for account deletion, including providing an in-app path and potentially a web link for deletion. Ensure your process meets these.

By providing clear, concise, and comprehensive information, you build user trust and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.
